Environment Variables
====================

There are just a couple of configurations managed as environment variables. In the development environment, these are injected by Docker Compose and managed in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

* `API_KEY` - A system wide API key validated in the `X-API-Key` header.
* `DATABASE_URL` - This is the connection URL for the PostgreSQL database. It is not used in the **development environment**.
* `CARD_IMAGE_PATH` - Path where card images are served.



Database Migrations
====================

Database migrations are handled by [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/) and files are stored in the `/sql` directory. Migrations are automatically applied when running tests with Nose. You can run migrations manually in the development environment using `docker-compose` too. The included script `local_migrate.sh` uses an environment variable created by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env/) to find the IP address assigned to the database and execute the Flyway command to run migrations.

```
docker-compose run web ./local_migrate.sh
```



Running Tests
====================

Tests, with code coverage reporting can be ran with the following command:
```
./local_test.sh
```



Routes
====================

All routes require that an API Key be included in the `X-API-Key` header.

* `404` if deck not found



### Draw cards from deck

**PUT:**
```
/deck/:id/draw
```

**Body:**
```json
{
    "count": 1
}
```

**Response:**

        }
    ]
}
```
